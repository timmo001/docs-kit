# @timmo001/docs-kit

Shared branding, layout and config for my documentation sites.

The root export renders brand images and doesn't depend on a docs tool. The
`blume` export holds the [Blume](https://github.com/haydenbleasel/blume) parts: a config helper, a
home page banner, a header GitHub link and a layout stylesheet. If the sites
move off Blume, the root export stays and a new tool gets its own entry point.

## Install

```sh
bun add -E @timmo001/docs-kit
```

The `blume` export needs the `blume` version in `peerDependencies`.

## Blume

### Config

`docsConfig` returns a full Blume config from the site details. Pass anything
else Blume accepts alongside them; it overrides the default it replaces, and
`navigation` and `seo` merge one level deep.

```ts
import { docsConfig } from "@timmo001/docs-kit/blume";
import { defineConfig } from "blume";

export default defineConfig(
  docsConfig({
    title: "Triage",
    description: "Pull request triage from the terminal.",
    site: "triage.timmo.dev",
    github: { owner: "timmo001", repo: "triage" },
    navigation: {
      sidebar: ["/", "/getting-started"],
    },
  }),
);
```

The defaults:

- Light and dark logos from `public/logo-light.svg` and `public/logo-dark.svg`,
  with the title as the logo text.
- Content in `src/content/docs`, last-modified dates from git and external links
  opening in a new tab.
- Cloudflare deployment to `https://<site>`.
- `llms.txt`, the MCP endpoint at `/mcp`, WebMCP and agent readability on. Ask
  AI and page feedback off.
- GitHub `branch` set to `main` and `dir` to `docs`, plus the header repository
  link.
- Generated share cards using `src/assets/logo.svg`, and an organisation logo at
  `/logo.png` (see [Brand images](#brand-images)).

### Components

Blume reads `components.ts` without running it, so import the components there
directly:

```ts
import HeaderSearch from "@timmo001/docs-kit/blume/header-search.astro";
import HomeBanner from "@timmo001/docs-kit/blume/home-banner.astro";
import { defineComponents } from "blume";

export default defineComponents({
  layout: {
    PageHeader: HomeBanner,
    Search: HeaderSearch,
  },
});
```

- `HomeBanner` shows the logo, title and description across the top of the home
  page and hides the page's own heading and lede. Other pages render nothing.
- `HeaderSearch` keeps Blume's search and adds a GitHub link after it when the
  config has a repository.

Both use scoped CSS, so they don't rely on Tailwind scanning `node_modules`.

### Theme

Import the layout styles from the site's `theme.css`:

```css
@import "@timmo001/docs-kit/blume/theme.css";
```

This widens the content column on large screens and keeps the "On this page"
rail next to the content. The banner's full-width layout relies on these
columns.

Set these in `theme.css` to change the banner:

```css
.home-banner {
  --home-banner-logo-size: 20rem;
  --home-banner-height: 30rem;
  --home-banner-background: #e4e4e7;
  --home-banner-background-dark: #09090b;
}
```

## Brand images

`writeBrandImages` renders PNGs from a square SVG logo with a `viewBox`: Open
Graph and GitHub social preview cards, a 512px logo and an Apple touch icon.
Leave an output out to skip it.

```ts
import { writeBrandImages } from "@timmo001/docs-kit";

await writeBrandImages({
  logo: "src/assets/logo.svg",
  title: "Triage",
  tagline: ["Pull request triage", "from the terminal."],
  site: "triage.timmo.dev",
  background: "#18181b",
  accent: "#d97706",
  outputs: {
    socialPreview: "../.github/social-preview.png",
    logo: "public/logo.png",
    appleTouchIcon: "public/apple-touch-icon.png",
  },
});
```

Blume makes its own per-page share cards, so a Blume site only needs `og` for
links outside the docs. GitHub doesn't read the social preview from the
repository; upload it under the repository settings.
